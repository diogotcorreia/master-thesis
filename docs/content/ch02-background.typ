== Python <bg:python>

The *Python programming language* was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum and has since
seen immense adoption from the programming community, with more than 50% of the respondents
of the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey having worked with it or wanting to @stack-overflow-survey-2024-most-popular.
It is used for many applications, such as scripting, web applications, machine learning, and much
more.
Some high-profile open-source programs that extensively use Python are

and

along with many companies like Netflix, Google and Reddit
that use it for their products as well.
For this reason, Python is a very valuable target for malicious attackers
and therefore extremely relevant for security researchers.
