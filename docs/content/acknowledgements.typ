This degree project would not have been possible without the help of many people,
without whom I would not have pursued studies at KTH nor have had the discipline to finish this work.
This is an incredibly important milestone in my life,
as it marks the end of my Master's studies and my formal education as a whole,
which I am extremely proud to complete.

First, I want to thank my friends, who were always there for me when I needed it,
and kept me motivated throughout my studies.
Rafa, your help reviewing this document,
and in general over the course of my time at KTH,
has been immeasurable and highly appreciated.
Thank you for being such a close friend and for helping me take my mind off my studies from time to time.
Tomás, thank you for encouraging me to keep on running all this time,
it kept me invaluably healthy and in good shape.
Gaspar, thank you for pushing me to apply for a Master's abroad:
I have no regrets, it has been a deeply fulfilling experience.
I am glad we could overcome the problems we could not anticipate.
To all my current and past corridor-mates, thank you for being such great neighbours.
Living in Stockholm would not have been the same without you.
To all others, who are too many to list here,
thank you for making my time at KTH one of the best times of my life.
You know who you are.

Then, to my family, and especially to my sister who misses me the most,
thank you for supporting me throughout this adventure,
and for being understanding when I moved across the continent.
Rest assured I have missed you all as well,
always looking forward to when I could fly back home.

To my supervisor, Musard,
thank you for encouraging me to pursue this topic
and for brainstorming ideas with me.
You have been an excellent supervisor,
and it has been a pleasure to work with you.
Roberto, thank you for accepting to be the examiner of this degree project,
for your sharp comments, and for your helpful availability.

Lastly, I want to emphasise that this document is exclusively written by humans,
as in, no generative artificial intelligence has been used.
This would not have been achievable without the meticulous reviews
of Rafa, Tomás, Henrique, Musard, and my opponent Yamini, all of whom I thank once again.
