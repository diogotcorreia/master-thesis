From the examples in @code:vulnerable-labels it is clear that the exploitability
of any vulnerable code that contains negative features is significantly lower
than when no negative features are present.
Furthermore, when no features at all are present, the code is still not trivially
exploitable, since only gadgets within the same class hierarchy, and the class
hierarchy of its attributes, can be used, as explored in @bg:lit-review.
